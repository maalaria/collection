#Language Evolution Device

Based on hypothesis that all what is needed to evolve language is the ability to create sounds and neural network subject to unsupervised learning.

### Draft

*Production modul*: Build device that randomly generates sounds taken from a set of sounds and which is able to perceive those.  
*Cognitive modul*: neural net that is subject to unsupervised classifier and which governs the production modul as soon as it is trained.
