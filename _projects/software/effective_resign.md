# Konzept

Develop a app that gives feedback about the effectiveness (in relation to other users) of abstinence. How effective is it actually if am a vegetarian etc. Necessarily this depends on the behavior of others - this has to be quantified.
The idea is that behavior is strongly dependent on the behavior of others and giving direct feedback enables to extend behavioral 'control' beyond local communities.
