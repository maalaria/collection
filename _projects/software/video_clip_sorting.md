# Video clib sorting algorithm

Automatiye what I did back then by hand.  

1. compare frame wise and determine scences
2. specify distance metric for scenes

Furthermore, learn the composition of movies and generate new
accordingly.

First part exists: [PySceneDetect](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect)
