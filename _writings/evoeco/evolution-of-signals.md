#A idea on the evolution of signals

The general definition of information as a process that induces a change (energy state, organization state...) in a system leads directly to the idea that signalling in organisms is a necissary development within the theory of natural selection, since transmitting information to cohabiter will induce a change, naturally controlling this change by controlling the signal leads to advantages.
