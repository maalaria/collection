#Dynamic levels of selection

The theory of mulilevel selection gnerally claims that natural selection operates on multiple organizational levels, molecules, organisms, populations.
Here I want to describe the idea that these dynamics are likely not to be constant but that the level at which selection acts depends itself  on the behavioral and environamental dynamics of a evolutionary species (i.e. a thing that is subject to evolution).
For example it is likely that effects of population selection are especially strong for species that serve as prey and thus the idivudual beeing more save within groups, another (contrary) example might be small hunters who have greater chances when hunting in groups.  In this context the nowadays much-loved complaints about the strengthening of egocentric behavior of humans might be a simple result of changing selective pressure, in that technological advancements undermine some aspects of social life (which is ovious) leading to decreased necessity of interaction.
