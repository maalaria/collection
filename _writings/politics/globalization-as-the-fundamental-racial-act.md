#Globalization as the fundamental racial act

It might be interesting to think about globalization as the fundamental racial act. I.e. the negation of differences, and the aim to overcome those.
Differnces seem to be the spokes in the wheels of transnational capital flows (thinkingabout about the differences between germany and greek for example – can both mentalities coexist in the same financial system?), but reversely those differnces are necissarily needed – to have the poor for cheap production and to have the rich for consumption.
Is this a fundemental discrepancy within the global capital system?
