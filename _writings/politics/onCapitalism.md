# On Capitalism

Consider global fruit trade. People are buying what is there...yammi
mango. In the meantime fruit agriculture in the southern hemisphere
and transportation to the northern is a major problem. No one would
ever stop it as long as those decisions are distributed, i.e. matter
of the free market. Selling fruits will always bring profit, so why
stop it?  

A decision to stop global fruit trade can only be achieved on a higher
level. i.e. on the level of a government. This implies that the free
market as such is not capable of organizing society taking objects
into account that are not monetary profitable but nevertheless
required for stabilizing the social or ecological realm.  

In general we live in a triad: (1) ourselves, or our egocentric
interests (2) our society, or our conspecifics and (3) our
environment, or everything else.
