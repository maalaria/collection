# Pure Democracy

*They will get the leaders they deserve*  
(based on a vague remembrance of Žižek citing Lacan)

After watching *Our Youth in Taiwan* I felt a deep disappointment and anger. About the apparent nature of civic movements and about the naivety and about directors like Fu Yue. That it is still the same in the 21st century, or the same again. I thought about Malcolm X, about Gandhi, about Mandela, about Ohnesorg. And then I thought about Mao, Hitler, Trump and Erdogan to name, again, just a few.  

Fu Yue said after the screening that she was disappointed as well, in fact that all the movie's end, when she weeped while talking to the movement's main protagonists, was about this disappointment. She was disappointed that Chen Wei-Ting and the other two from China and HK did not solve the problem two of the countries have with the third one. I was disappointed that today narcissistic psychopaths are uncritically portrayed as civic movement heroes and as opponents to structures of power they themselves embody. Criticising him for grabbing breasts points to the problem but misses the core. The core of what he represented - a charismatic leader gathering souls in his seek for power.  

How can a director miss this? How can a democratic movement start without falling down this fallacy?  

Fu Yue did not understand this much deeper problem of democratic, civic movements (ok, maybe not all, depending on the leading person). She talked about the elder ones which, in her own words, still relay on old fashioned idolised personnel. I thought she can't be serious, but nothing deeply self-critical came. Does she know her own movie? A whiff of self-reflection was lost in indulgence when shortly before ending the occupation the movement's leadership feared of becoming what they intended to fight. But this was in the end! I am talking about the beginning. She was just disappointed that it didn't work out. Well, who isn't.
