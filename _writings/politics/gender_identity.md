# From gender identity to totalitarianism

Is the enforcement of using language that supports exercise of individual rights totalitarian?  

Cf. Theory of Cultural tightness-looseness  

Important to differentiate: Do restrictions touch the *private* sphere of people or does it limit the *public*?  
I may be inclined to argue that something is only totalitarian iff :-) it touches the private sphere of people. This brings the question of identity in focus; ethnical, gender and and and. Is identity private of public? It looks like both. Our identity is our interface with which we encounter others, it is part of the private as well es the public sphere. Even more, one may argue that the public sphere is build by the interaction of our identities. Identity is fundamental to the public sphere as well as to the private sphere. It seems that we have a problem here.

The case of Jordan Peterson is very interesting. His refusal to accept the Canadian law (Bill C-16) enforcing the use of gender neutral personal pronouns is both liberal and ideological in itself depending on the perspective.  
Assuming that Bill C-16 introduces a restriction on the public use of language
