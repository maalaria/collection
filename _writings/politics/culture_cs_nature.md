# Cultural evolution may be partially independent from biological evolution

Who shapes culture? Some people? For the following idea I assume two things: (1) Certain individuals shape cultural developments more than others and (2) there is variability in the behavioral preferences/attitudes.  
If that is true then - in the long term - cultural evolution shapes our (cultural) environment in a way that does not match the behavioral preferences of the majority.

The central question is whether people who become influential are randomly drawn from the population (I am talking about the statistical process) or if there are predispositions that increase the probability to become influential. This question unfortunately cannot easily be answered. An obvious example, though, might suggest that the latter is at least partially the case: there is a predominance of males among leaders suggesting that certain traits, that are predominantly present in the male subpopulation, help to that effect and that the causal direction is not the reverse one (becoming influential causing the development of certain traits).  

The picture I am drafting looks like this: In a given cultural environment (which is determined by ecological constraints and preceding cultural developments) certain traits are have a higher prevalence in the group of (potential) leaders who shape the cultural environment accordingly. Since the amount of leaders is much smaller than the amount of common citizens their
