#What means a system has purpose?

This refers to a quote from R. Dawkins (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiwLrxPb1fE).
I basically think that one can speak of a purpose of a system always when the given system interacts with the system in which it is embedded, i.e. the suprasystem, in a certain manner. What this certain manner is, is the difficult question..
