#On Intelligence

What is Intelligence? People seem to have problems with defining it, and this might be due Weltanschauung.
Why? ...Because intelligence is a political object in times of competing definitions of humans. Especially since a specific form of intelligence seems to be more imporatant than ohters today (logical inference).
The last sentence already hints at my purpose: proclaiming a general conception of intelliance – simply as generic problem solving abilities.
Since every organism faces multiple different problems –  finding food,  socializing, computing, drawing (basically everything that a living organism does might be seen as a problem solving task) – it seems reasonable to assume that each of them is solved, or at least tentatively solved, by a cetain problem solving, made up by our brains.
Therefor speaking of the intellegince is simply not enough. Each problem has its own intelligence – for sure, since problems overlap, intelligences overlap. I guess some hierachical model might be appropriate.
