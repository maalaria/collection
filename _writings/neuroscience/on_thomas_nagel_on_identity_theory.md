# On Thomas Nagels arguments against the Identity Theory

His argument goes like this:  

The inventors of the identity theory use identities like H2O=water as
an example for Psi=Phi. According to Kripke, though, the relation of
Psi/Phi is contigent.  

Nagel uses his critic on the identiy theory as a critic on a
reductionist picture of the mental in general.  

But Water is not H2O! Water has affordances that H2O does not
have. H2O is the objecitfied version of Water. There is H2O without
water, The H atom in H2O does not see the H2O.

His central claim is then, that each possible Phi may occur without
any Psi, and that is why identity theory is false.  

And it is, as I said concerning water. Water/H2O is likewise in a
contingent relation.
