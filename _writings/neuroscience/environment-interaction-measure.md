# Measure for interaction with Environment

Motivation: Given the assumption that cosciousness is function in some ecological way and that the amount of consciousness is rather continous than discrete (cf. IIT), there should be a correlation of the the amount of consciousness and the amount (quality or quantity) of interaction with the environment. So to foster the idea of IIT a measurement of interaction of a given system with its environment should be designed and analysed for  correlation of the amount of phi of the system.
