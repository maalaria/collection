#Mystification of Science

Example: Quantum Mechanics is not understood (intuitively) thus it is mystifies. People dont like things they don't undetstand thus elevating non-understanding to a fundamental principle enveloping it into particular concept oder term that can be handled: for example 'god', 'nature' (in a new age sense) â€¦
The mystification of quantum mechanics thus somehow fits into this pattern of dealing with non-understanding.
