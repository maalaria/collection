# Why research may not be neutral

An Algorithm in isolation is useless. It has no meaning and no purpose. In isolation it may bring fun to some nerdy Elfenbeinturmisten, but such kind of meaning is not beyond playing exotic games like quidditch.
Algorithms are always used, they want to be used, they are created to be used. How they are used decides society -- the social and political environemnt with its specific values and needs.
