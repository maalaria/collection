# Levels of Identity

There are people that I encounter first. Most often my mother, my father, any siblings. They love and feed me and provide warmth. Which is named home. If I have a home, do I also have an identity, do I *belief* in my mother and what is my mother's modality?

My nationality, my convictions I encounter later. When I learn that things I cannot see and will never see and feel exist. When I learn to belief. Have I seen Germany? - I have seen landscapes and buildings. I *belief* in Germany - Germany exists but what is Germany's modality?  

My identity is what I identify with. Do I identify with my family? - I am part of my family.  
Do I identify with Germany? - I am part of Germany.
Have I seen my family? - I have seen my mother, my father. I have received warmth and love.  
I have received education and infrastructure.  

I am beloved, warmed up, educated and infrastructured.

Being part of Germany, I am part of a collective whose members I cannot know. Members that utters to be german. Members I don't know and will never know. People to whom I cannot apologize when I affect their lives. My family utters to be a family. There is no way to not know my family. Well, there is are ways, but I can always be sure that at least my father and my mother exist as individuals. Their existence is biological necessary. I don't know who exists in Germany and there is no way to know even though their existence is conceptually necessary.  

My family is private. Germany is public.  

Knowing individuals and the presence of absence of individuals seems to be the essence when I ask about the levels of my identity.
