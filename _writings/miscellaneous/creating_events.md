#Creating events
Inspired by: [Rajiv Maheswaran](http://www.ted.com/talks/rajiv_maheswaran_the_math_behind_basketball_s_wildest_moves)

He claims that he believes that understanding moving dots will lead to samerter, better movement of people etc. E.g. a machine could tell him when is daughter will make his first steps so he won't miss them.
Indeed this means that movement becomes more rational in a calssical sense, i.e. more focused an specific.
But it is defenitly a bypass if one interpretes this as the development of a better 'life'. Maybe it would be better if spends more time with his daughter in general and aim for events.  

I claim that the basic propertiy of such a development would be that life would essentially become more eventful in that movement becomes more specific. Gaps will disappear.
But who knows if those gaps are not important?
