# Is scientists reaction to Trump ideological?

Popper distinguished science and pseudo-science and the latter he said
is ideology
(https://philosophynow.org/issues/15/Is_Science_an_Ideology). If a
theory is not falsifiable than it is ideological. Ok. But what
question do you have to ask us scientists that we can't falsify
anymore? What about the general role of science in society? Does
science make life better? That's maybe the appropriate question. In on
the first sight this questions seems to be falsifiable. But is it?
Maybe not. A better life can have different meanings and any answer to
that question depends on the current paradigms of society -- the
itself seems to be inherently ideological. So, for each single society
with its paradigms it certainly is falsifiable but not for each
society at the same time. In that science appears ideological.

BUT, after all, referring to everything that shapes human society on
the cultural level as ideology renders the term useless. So, when does
science become ideology? Never? I guess it's an ethical question – as
soon as science as such is the justification for science itself – the
famous ivory tower – maybe then it is ideology. But before it is not.

Fighting for the freedom if science seems to be justified as long as
it focuses on the civilian, liberal values of society.
